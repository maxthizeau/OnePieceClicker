# Introduction

Hello, I'm Maxime Thizeau, a french front end web developer.

I was looking for a project to do to learn and train in React when I discovered the game Pokeclicker. Feeling that I could make this kind of game with my skills, I decided to create a clicker game too. In order to make it a bit more fun to create and play, I used the world of One Piece, its characters and its story.

I used a lot of data from the game One Piece Treasure Cruise and [OPTC-DB](https://optc-db.github.io/), so a special thanks to them for their work.

# Still under development

The game is live, you can play using the link at the top of this description.

But, it's still under development there is still some work to do : Especially add some Unit Testing and improve performance and loading time.

Also, I might do some adjustment and balance change later. Feel free to tell me if you think about a change that could make the game better !

# Just want to test the features without playing a full game?

If you just want to test all the features without playing from the start, you can download **[this save](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxthizeau/OnePieceClicker/master/public/opc_save_6_26_2022_1658826048377.txt)** and import it.

**How to import a save :**

- Open the Menu in the Top/Left corner
